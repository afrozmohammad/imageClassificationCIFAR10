# imageClassificationCIFAR10
Image classification is an important and useful process in many data processing fields and business applications. In this project, we employ the Gaussian Naïve Bayes, k – Nearest Neighbor and Logistic Regression classifiers for multiclass classification. The model is trained with 2000 images of the CIFAR-10 dataset. The classifier is capable of classifying images across ten classes. This report involves the method followed to extract the features, train the model, prediction and evaluation results.
